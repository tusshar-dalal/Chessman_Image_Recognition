# Chessman_Image_Recognition

We are trying to build a model using CNN for recognising the Chessman images from the given dataset. We will be building model using Tensorflow Keras.

The dataset has 483 images in total divided into 6 classes.

To avoid overfitting of model, Data Augmentation is performed using Image Generator utility from Tensorflow.
