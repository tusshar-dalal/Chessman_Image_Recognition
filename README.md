# Chessman_Image_Recognition

We are trying to build a model using CNN for recognising the Chessman images from the given dataset. We will be building model using Tensorflow Keras.

The dataset has 483 images in total divided into 6 classes.

For avoiding Overfitting, Data Augmentation is performed using Image Generator utility from Tensorflow.

On using a pre-trained model ResNet, a drastic improvement was seen in Accuracy of Model.

Accuracy can further be increased by performing Hyperparameter tuning and trying different pretrained model or ResNet trained on some other dataset.
